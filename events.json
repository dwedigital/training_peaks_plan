Be sure to choose a flat, fast road or track to perform the test on. Do not choose a day when there is a tailwind or a downhill course.\n\nPerform a thorough warm up (10-15mins) before starting the test.

Try not to start too fast and have to slow down due to fatigue as this will produce an inaccurate result.\n\nAt the 10 minute mark, make a note of your heart rate. When you stop at 30 minutes, make a note of your heart rate. Add these two heart rate values together then divide by two and this is your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate.
